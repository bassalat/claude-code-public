# Humanize AI Content

Transform AI-generated text into authentic, human-sounding content by addressing the linguistic patterns that detection algorithms flag.

## Core Workflow

1. **Analyze** - Identify AI patterns in the content
2. **Restructure** - Vary sentence lengths and structures
3. **Replace** - Swap flagged vocabulary with natural alternatives
4. **Inject** - Add human elements (specifics, opinions, imperfections)
5. **Verify** - Read aloud test and final review

---

## Step 1: Analyze for AI Patterns

Scan content for these detection triggers:

**Vocabulary flags** (key offenders):
- delve, tapestry, landscape, realm, leverage, utilize, facilitate, pivotal, meticulous, comprehensive, vibrant, intricate, seamless, robust, synergy, multifaceted, nuanced, palpable

**Structural flags:**
- Uniform sentence lengths (AI averages 15-20 words consistently)
- Excessive present participial phrases ("leaning on," "evading," "considering")
- Overuse of nominalizations (turning verbs into nouns)
- Perfect parallel structure in lists
- Em-dash overuse

**Opening red flags:**
- "In today's fast-paced world"
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of"
- "It is essential to understand"
- "A rich tapestry of"
- "Navigate the complexities of"

**Problem-solution pivot phrases** (predictable narrative structure):
- "So I built my own" -> "I ended up writing something simpler" / "I put together a basic version" / just start describing what you made
- "That's why I created" -> "I made" / "I wrote" / skip the transition entirely
- "This led me to develop" -> "I ended up building" / "Eventually I just made"
- "To solve this problem, I" -> Just describe the solution without announcing it
- "So I decided to" -> "I ended up" / "I started" / remove and restructure

The pattern to avoid: [Problem paragraph] → [Triumphant pivot phrase] → [Solution paragraph]. This structure is predictable. Instead, let the solution emerge naturally or blend the problem and solution together.

## Step 2: Restructure for Burstiness

AI text has low "burstiness" - uniform sentence patterns. Fix by:

**Mix sentence lengths dramatically**
- Add very short sentences (3-7 words): "That's the key." "Here's why." "Not quite."
- Keep some longer explanatory sentences (25-35 words)
- Avoid the 15-20 word middle ground AI favors

**Vary sentence openings**
- Start some with "And," "But," "So," "Or"
- Use questions: "What does this mean?"
- Begin with specifics: "Last Tuesday," "In my experience,"

**Break perfect structures**
- If a list has 3 parallel items, make one different
- Interrupt flow with parentheticals or asides
- Use sentence fragments occasionally

## Step 3: Replace Flagged Vocabulary

## Step 4: Inject Human Elements

Add what AI cannot generate:

**Specificity**
- Replace "many companies" with "companies like Stripe, Notion, and Linear"
- Replace "recently" with "last month" or "in Q3"
- Replace "significant growth" with "42% year-over-year growth"

**Personal markers**
- Add first-person observations: "I've found that..." "In my experience..."
- Include mild opinions: "Honestly," "To be fair," "I'd argue"
- Reference real context: current events, specific tools, named examples

**Imperfections**
- Use contractions: "you're," "it's," "don't," "won't"
- Add conversational fillers sparingly: "you know," "kind of," "actually"
- Include self-corrections: "or rather," "well, actually"

**Rhetorical questions**
- Add at least one per major section
- "But here's the thing - does this actually work?"

---

## Step 5: Verify

**Read-aloud test**: If any sentence sounds awkward when spoken, it contains AI patterns. Rewrite it.

**Opening sentence check**: The first 2-3 sentences receive highest detection scrutiny. Manually rewrite these even if the rest passes.

**Structure check**: Ensure paragraphs vary in length. Avoid the AI pattern of 3-4 sentences per paragraph consistently.

## Quick Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] No flagged words from the avoid lists above
- [ ] Sentence lengths vary (some <10 words, some >25)
- [ ] At least 2-3 sentences start with And/But/So
- [ ] Contains specific numbers, names, or dates
- [ ] Uses contractions throughout
- [ ] Opening sentences manually crafted
- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud
- [ ] No more than 2 em-dashes in entire piece

---

## Grammar Patterns to Avoid

**Present participial phrases** (AI uses 2-5x more than humans):
- "Leaning on his expertise" -> "He used his expertise"
- "Considering the options" -> "When we looked at the options"
- "Making use of" -> "Using"

**Nominalizations** (turning verbs into nouns):
- "The implementation of" -> "Implementing" or "When we implemented"
- "The utilization of" -> "Using"
- "Make a decision" -> "Decide"
- "Provide assistance" -> "Help"

**Passive voice overuse**:
- "It was decided that" -> "We decided"
- "The project was completed" -> "We finished the project"

**Em-dash overuse**: Limit to 1-2 per piece. Replace with commas, parentheses, colons, or periods.

## How to Use This Skill

When humanizing content:

1. Paste the AI-generated text
2. I will analyze it for AI patterns
3. Rewrite following the guidelines above
4. Return natural, human-sounding content

The goal is text that reads like a real person wrote it - with personality, imperfections, and authentic voice.
